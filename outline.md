SQL Refresher

This document describes the refresher 'course' given about SQL.  It is purely a simple notes kind of approach.  I tend to want very simple SQL for speed of analysis.  This is not meant to be a course in database administration, or SQL or analysis, but a general idea of how I manage SQL for analytics.
