SQL Refresher
-------------

This document describes the refresher 'course' given about SQL.  It is purely a simple notes kind of approach.  I tend to want very simple SQL for speed of analysis.  This is not meant to be a course in database administration, or SQL or analysis, but a general idea of how I manage SQL for analytics.  

Dependencies
------------
[Here](https://github.com/feomike/sql_refresher/blob/master/dependencies.md) I outline the kinds of things I make sure i have in place before moving forward w/ an analysis.

Step 1: Setup - anatomy of a SQL client
- the database has to be running.  these databases are enterprise class, so they typically need a server to run.  In the Postgres version from Boundless, it will run in the background, and will continue to run until you turn the machine off.  When you turn it back on you will need to restart the database server.  
- I will not cover tablespaces, groups and roles
- databases have schema's, tables, views, index's 
- schema's are containers to logically group tables

Step 2: Getting Data In/Getting Data Out

Step 3: SQL Statements Outline

Step 4: First Investigation Approach

Step 5: Indexes

Step 6: Joins

Step 6: Resources
