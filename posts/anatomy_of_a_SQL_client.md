Anatomy of a SQL Client
-----------------------

- the database has to be running.  these databases are enterprise class, so they typically need a server to run.  In the Postgres version from Boundless, it will run in the background, and will continue to run until you turn the machine off.  When you turn it back on you will need to restart the database server.  
- I will not cover tablespaces, groups and roles
- databases have schema's, tables, views, index's 
- schema's are containers to logically group tables
